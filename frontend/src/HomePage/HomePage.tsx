// Important Note
// The pattern of implementing a function prop to allow consumers to render an
// internal piece of the component is often referred to as a render prop. It makes
// the component extremely flexible and useable in many different scenarios.

// Important Note
// The useEffect hook is a function that allows a side effect, such as fetching
// data, to be performed in a component. The function takes in two parameters,
// with the first parameter being a function to execute. The second parameter
// determines when the function in the first parameter should be executed.
// This is defined in an array of variables that, if changed, results in the first
// parameter function being executed. If the array is empty, then the function is
// only executed once the component has been rendered for the first time. More
// information can be found at https://reactjs.org/docs/hookseffect.html

// Important Note
// The useState function returns an array containing the state variable in
// the first element and a function to set the state in the second element. The
// initial value of the state variable is passed into the function as a parameter. The
// TypeScript type for the state variable can be passed to the function as a generic
// type parameter. More information can be found at https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html

// Important Note
// The HomePage component is what is called a container component,
// with QuestionList and Question being presentational components.
// Container components are responsible for how things work, fetching any
// data from a web API, and managing state. Presentational components are
// responsible for how things look. Presentational components receive data via
// their props, and also have property event handlers so that their containers can
// manage user interactions.

// Important Note
// Event listeners in JSX can be attached using a function prop that is named
// with on before the native JavaScript event name in camel case. So, a
// native click event can be attached using an onClick function prop. React
// will automatically remove the event listener for us before the element is
// destroyed.
